### Description:

Rouen [1], 29 March 1448<br />
*Receipt by Guillaume Duru, “clerc de Monsieur le tresorier de Normandie,” for six skins of parchment to be used for writing certain royal ordinances for the government of Normandy*<br />
Chicago, Newberry Library, Wing MS ZW 1 .448

### Background:

This receipt, signed by Guillaume Du Ru, documents the purchase of six sheets of parchment—calfskins—appropriate for writing on both sides. Du Ru was a scribe to the squire and soldier John Stanlaw (or Stanlow), who served as treasurer of Normandy in the 1440s, when the region was under the control of King Henry VI of England. Du Ru signed documents on Stanlaw’s behalf and was in charge of purchasing parchment to perform his duty. Du Ru was established in Rouen, as was Louis de Bavent, bookseller and parchment maker, who provided calfskins to clients such as Henri VI's representatives.
