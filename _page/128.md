French Renaissance Paleography extends into the digital realm the Newberry Library's nearly four decades of experience offering intensive classroom-based instruction in late medieval and Renaissance vernacular paleography. Drawing on the library's expertise with that face-to-face educational format, this digital resource aims to bring the study of early French manuscript culture to an even larger audience than can be accommodated in a classroom. This site provides a set of self-help tools to assist students, researchers, librarians, calligraphers, and designers with reading French manuscripts dating from 1300 to 1700 and understanding their contexts. It aims to foster collaborations across disciplines and generate new knowledge through the intersection of individual and group work.


<em>The French Renaissance Paleography project is a collaborative project supported by a grant from The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation</em>.
