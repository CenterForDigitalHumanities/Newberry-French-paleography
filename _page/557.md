### About the *French Renaissance Paleography* website

Paleography is the history and study of handwriting. Old scripts can be very beautiful, but sometimes difficult to read. The *French Renaissance Paleography* site presents over 100 carefully selected French manuscripts written between 1300 and 1700, with tools for deciphering them and learning about their social, cultural, and institutional settings.


The site is a [collaborative](about-team) project supported by a grant from The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation.

### Finding Manuscripts <a id="Browse" name="Browse"></a>

Users can browse the website by Digital Collection and filter records with many encoded facets. The items selected for this collection are focused on the learning of paleography and are not representative or inclusive of the entire Newberry collection. In some cases, longer documents may even be presented here abbreviated, with a link to a more complete record.

Visiting the page for [Manuscripts]({{"/www/manuscripts.html" | relative_url}}) will show a list of all manuscripts in the collection. Under each thumbnail is a "View" button, which will take you to the page for the manuscript, where you can navigate the digital facsimile, view related information and documents, or begin a transcription project.

![]({{"/www/images/browse.png" | relative_url}})

In the box to the left under "Refine Results", any typed term will be used to filter the results. More simply, clicking any category below will show only matching documents.

### Browsing References and Resources <a id="References" name="References"></a>

The Newberry Library has provided partial transcriptions of many documents in the site, so that users can check their work. However, full transcriptions have not been provided, so that teachers can assign untranscribed sections for student practice.

Also, the Newberry Library has included background essays for some of the documents. Classes are invited to "adopt" a document that does not have an essay and submit a draft background essay for review, editing, and possible inclusion in the site.

Not sure where to start? or who to ask? There are several options for anyone looking for more information. The <a href="resources">Resources</a> and <a href="reference">Reference</a> pages (also available in the main site navigation) provide backgound information for many of the manuscripts and for the subject of paleography.

### Transcription <a id="Quick-Start" name="Quick-Start"></a>

Users are encouraged to practice transcribing any of the manuscript documents in this site and save their transcriptions to return to another day. 

From the desired manuscript and click on the Transcribe with TPEN link above the viewer. This will open the manuscript in a transcription window, entering your existing project or creating a new one.

![]({{"/www/images/ms-transcribe.png" | relative_url}})

### Using the Transcription Interface <a id="TPEN" name="TPEN"></a>

Click on the text transcription box (if no transcription is present the "Enter a line transcription" prompt will appear). Type a transcription of the segment of the image highlighted above the transcription workspace.

Moving to the next line automatically saves the text. Like most interactions, this can be done in several ways:

* Click the "Next" or "Prev" line button,
* Press <kdb>enter</kbd>, <kbd>return</kbd>, or <kdb>tab</kbd> (with <kbd>shift</kbd> to go backwards), or
* Hold <kbd>alt</kbd> and <kbd>&uarr;</kbd> or <kbd>&darr;</kbd>.

Hit the Return key to save the line of transcription.<br />
When the end of a page is reached, click on the *next* button in the Page box on the Transcription Tool Bar and repeat the process.

You also can share your transcriptions with other individuals or a group. To do so, use the "Manage Team" button in the TPEN transcription tool.

<h5><a id="How to Transcribe" name="How to Transcribe"></a>How to Transcribe</h5>

All of the manuscript documents have been pre-parsed for use with the T-PEN transcription tool, but sometimes small adjustments are needed. Users can make those adjustments for themselves, using the Correct Parsing button.


If a teacher wishes to correct parsing in any of the documents, globally, for all future users, he or she can request special administrative privileges. A user who has been granted administrative privileges will see an Edit Master Documents button (not accessible to regular users), which allows him/her to correct the parsing in the master document, not just in an individual project.

<h5><a id="Using the Tools and the Transcription Tool Bar" name="Using the Tools and the Transcription Tool Bar"></a>Using the Tools and the Transcription Tool Bar</h5>

The Transcription Tool Bar has a number of tools to facilitate the transcription.

<h5><a id="Text Transcription Box, Previous Line, & Column/Line Boxes" name="Text Transcription Box, Previous Line, & Column/Line Boxes"></a>Text Transcription Box, Previous Line, & Column/Line Boxes </h5>

The white box in the center of the Transcription Tool Bar is the Text Transcription box. It corresponds to the highlighted box on the manuscript image. Once the line of text has been transcribed, press Return to save the text and move to the next line.<br />
The image will automatically adjust to present the next line highlighted and directly above the Transcription Tool Bar, ready for transcription.<br />
Directly above the Text Transcription box, the previous line of transcription will be presented in the Previous Line box to help in transcription. This line is not editable. To correct or change the previous line, click on the *prev *button in the Line box on the right of the Text Transcription box. On the right side of both these boxes, the Column letter and line number will be presented together in their respective Column/Line boxes. These correspond to the Letter/Number labels on the boxes on the manuscript image:



<img alt="" src="www/images/slide1_1.jpg" style="width: 600px; height: 338px;" />

<h5><a id="Characters" name="Characters"></a>Characters </h5>

Manuscripts often have characters that are no longer used in the modern English alphabet. Sometimes they are short hand or abbreviations for common works as well as performing other functions. The Characters* *pull-down contains some of these characters as appropriate to the text.<br />
To use the Characters* *pull down click on the pull-down and select the desired character from the list, then continue transcribing.

<h5><a id="XML Tags" name="XML Tags"></a>XML Tags</h5>

XML Tags allow the transcriber to add additional information about the text as it is transcribed. The XML Tags pull-down contains a list of these tags.  XML tags have an opening and a closing tag. When a tag is added to the transcription a small icon of the matching closing tab appears on the bottom right of the Text Transcription box, as a reminder that the XML tag closing tag needs to added to the transcription.<br />
To open an XML tag click on the XML Tags* *pull down and select the desired XML Tag from the list then continue transcribing.<br />
To close, click on the small icon of the matching closing tab.

<h5><a id="Split Page Tools" name="Split Page Tools"></a>Split Page Tools </h5>

The Split Page Tools are a selection for supporting materials that can be called up as needed during the transcription process . The careen will be divided into two halves with the transcription page on the left and the split page content on the right.<br />
To use the Split Screen* *pull down, click on the pull down and select the desired screen view from the list provided:



<img alt="" src="www/images/split.jpg" style="width: 600px; height: 338px;" />

<h5><a id="Image Tools" name="Image Tools"></a>Image Tools </h5>

Sometimes the image or condition of the original manuscript makes reading the text very difficult. To help with this the image Tools Box provides four basic image adjustment tools:

<ol><li>Grayscale button</li>
<li>Invert button</li>
<li>Brightness adjustment slider</li>
<li>Contrast adjustment slider</li>
</ol>
To use, click on the Image Tools tab. The Grayscale and Invert buttons can be clicked on and off as desired, and you can click and drag the sliders as desired.<br />
Please note that these adjustments do not carry over to other pages within the manuscript and will disappear once you leave the page:



<img alt="" src="www/images/slide2_1_0.jpg" style="width: 600px; height: 338px;" />

<h5><a id="Magnify" name="Magnify"></a>Magnify</h5>

To use, click on the Magnify button. The Transcription Tool Bar will disappear and a selective magnifying "Loop" will appear. Run the "Loop" over the areas of interest on the manuscript as desired. Type + [plus] to enlarge the image in the  "Loop." Type – [minus] to reduce the image in the "Loop." Hit ESC to return to the Transcription Tool Bar.   

<h5><a id="Move Image" name="Move Image"></a>Move Image </h5>

Move image allows the image to be moved to see other parts of the manuscript image as needed.<br />
To use, click the Move Img button. Click and drag the manuscript images as desired. The move image function will remain active until another tool is selected or the Move Img button is clicked again. 

<h5><a id="Move Transcription Tool Bar" name="Move Transcription Tool Bar"></a>Move Transcription Tool Bar </h5>

On the top left and right of the Transcription Tool Bar there are grab bars that if clicked and dragged will move the Transcription Tool Bar up and down as desired:



<img alt="" src="www/images/slide3_1.jpg" style="width: 600px; height: 338px;" />

<h4><u>Navigation in T-PEN</u></h4>
<h5><a id="Line to Line" name="Line to Line"></a>Line to Line </h5>

There are three ways to navigate from line to line:

<ol><li>To navigate from line to line click the *next* or *prev b*uttons in the Line box on the right of the Text Transcription box</li>
<li> If the Text Preview Split Page Tool is selected, click on the desired line on the right side of the screen and the appropriate line will be called up in the transcription area on the left</li>
<li>To move to the next line at the end of a line of transcription press Return.</li>
</ol><h5><a id="Page to Page" name="Page to Page"></a>Page to Page</h5>

There are three ways to navigate between pages:

<ol><li>Click on the *next* or *prev* buttons in the Page Box on the left of the Text Transcription Box</li>
<li>Click on the *jump to page* pull down in the middle of the top bar of the page to select a specific page anywhere in the manuscript.</li>
<li>On the left and right of the *jump to page* pull-down there are icons.</li>
</ol><p style="margin-left: 40px">On the left side:<br />

Click on the double arrow pointing left to go to the previous page.

<p style="margin-left: 40px">On the right side:<br />
Click on the single arrow and line pointing right to go to the last page in the manuscript.<br />
Click on the double arrow pointing left to go to the next page. 

<h5><a id="Manuscript Image Boxes" name="Manuscript Image Boxes"></a>Manuscript Image Boxes </h5>

Each line of text on the manuscript image is bounded by a colored line. Each bounding line has the column letter and line number visible on the right side.<br />
Theses lines can be edited in a number of ways. This is done via the Line Control box on the right side on the Transcription Tool Bar.<br />
All lines except the line being transcribed can be hidden or revealed by clicking on the lines checkbox. Clicking on the Line #s checkbox hides or reveals all the column letters and line numbers on the manuscript image. The color of the lines can be changed by repeated clicking on the Line Color button until a preferred color is shown. 

<h5><a id="The Manuscript Image" name="The Manuscript Image"></a>The Manuscript Image </h5>

The image of the manuscript will have a series of boxes overlaid over it. Each box will have a letter and number:

<p style="margin-left: 40px">a. The letter indicates the column<br />
b. The number indicates the row.


The color and presentation of the boxes can be edited via the line control box on the Transcription Tool Bar.<br />
The Transcription window presents the image of the first page of the manuscript with the Transcription Tool Bar splitting the image, to allow the entire image to be visible at all times:
