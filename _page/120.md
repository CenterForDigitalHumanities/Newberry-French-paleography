### Group work with the TPEN transcription tool

Users can practice transcribing any of the manuscript documents in this site and save their transcriptions to return to another day. You also can share your transcriptions with other individuals or a group. To do so, use the "Collaboration" tab in the TPEN project management.

All of the manuscript documents have been pre-parsed for use with the TPEN transcription tool, but sometimes small adjustments are needed. If a teacher wishes to correct parsing in any of the documents, globally, for all future users, he or she can edit the project and then notify the Newberry team to review the changes for all future users.
